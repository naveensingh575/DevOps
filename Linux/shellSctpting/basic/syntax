which python , which java and which bash - give the path of exetable of language
whereis python - all paths
#!/path - shbang - put in first line of a code.
variable - it is a reserved memory location to store values.
  in bash we have dynamic vaiable, there is no concept of data type.
  name="Naveen Kumar"

output (to print)
  echo $name
  echo "Your name is $name" - Your name is Naveen Kumar
  echo 'Your name is $name" - Your name is $name   -- single quote don't get the quotation.

input (to get value from user)
  echo "Where are you from?"
  #read $city - this wrong, variable don't need $ but while printing need to give
  read city
  echo "I am from $city"
  
Arthmatic (as bash treat everything as string, so for arthmatic need to define in special way)
  #!/usr/bin/bash
  echo "Enter two no. for sumation"
  read num1
  read num2
  sum=`expr $num1 + $num2` 
  #sum=`expr $num1+$num2` - o/p us num1+num2
  echo "The sum of above two no. is: $sum"
  echo $(expr $num1 + $num2)
  echo `expr $num1 + $num2`
  echo $((num1 + num2))
  echo " date is : $(date)"
